 *Provide answer here*

* Have you documented your code? 

 *Provide answer here*

* How did you test all major functionality of the project?

 *Provide answer here*
 
 * Does your project have any memory leaks? How did you test for memory leaks?

  *Provide answer here*
  
 * Tell us where we can find use of a datastructure and inheritance in your project.
 
  *Provide answer here*
  
 * Tells us if you've implmented any of the bonus features, where we can find them, and what they are.
 
  *Provide answer here*
  
* Provide the URL to your demo or indicate where it is pushed in the repo
 
 *Provide answer here*
 
* How many hours have did you spend on the proejct?

 *Provide answer here*

# Logistics

The demo video is to be delivered by Tuesday 04/14 at 8am. Normally we would have in class presentations but we will use the last class time to watch the videos provided by all teams. You can keep working on your project till Wednesday 04/15 at midnight. Let us know if you have any questions.
